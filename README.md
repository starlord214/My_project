# My_project
This project is a simple math addition game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game displays two random numbers, and the user must enter the correct sum. If the user answers correctly on the first attempt, their score increases by 1 and a new question is generated. The game continues until the user enters a wrong answer.
